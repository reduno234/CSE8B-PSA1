/** Writing Tester Methods

Methods take in an input and returns and output. But what if you wanted to
know that, for some input s, the method will return the correct output t? 

NOTE: This file provides various examples of how to write testers. But by
no means are they mandatory. The only thing that is "mandatory" is learning
how to test you code, which is usually done by writing testers. Thus, this
file simply contains examples and explanations about the testers. 

There are a few ways you can write testers:
- Write print statements inside your code to determine behavior internally.
- Write tester methods that will test functions with a series of inputs and 
returns, for example, true or false depending on whether all inputs produced
correct outputs.
- Write your methods to return if all inputs works and throws an 
Exception when a wrong behavior is found. This might be the newest form of testing.

    /** Writing a Tester Method and Normal Cases

    Suppose I had written a method add() which takes in two Integers and returns
    the sum as an Integer. Some normal cases would be to put in two integer 
    numbers and see what it returns.

    It basically summarizes down to:
    1. What are the inputs that can crash the program?
    2. What are the inputs that produces wrong outputs?

    With that in mind, you should be able to now write your own testers.

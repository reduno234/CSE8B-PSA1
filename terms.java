/** methods */
/* are a way to define program behavior.
 * 
 * if defined and called statically, then a method simply
 * takes in inputs, does some behavior and returns results.
 *
 * if not defined and called statically, then a method 
 * for a particular instance of a class, takes in inputs, does
 * some behavior, and returns results. 
 */

/** parameters */
/* in a definition of a method you define the inputs: 
 * the types and their order both matter.
 */

/** arguments */ 
/* the data you feed into a method in runtime.
 * There must exist a compiled method where the types and order
 * of your arguments matches the parameters of a defined method. 
 */

/** method definition */

/* the action of writing a method, or the method's written 
 * behavior itself. 
 */

/** method call */ 

/* the action of executing a method 
 * it can mean either your intention to call, or the program's 
 * behavior to call. 
 * */

/** instance */
/* can be used in the same way as "objects" 
 * when you create an "instance" of something, you created
 * an individual of the class. 
 *
 * for example, an instance of a Turtle is something that can
 * execute Turtle methods and contains its own personal data. 
 */

/** types */
/* include int, char, String, Turtle
 * can mean primitive types and Object types. 
 * When one says your method takes in the wrong types, they 
 * are saying that your method takes as input the wrong
 * kinds of data the method is expecting. 
 *
 * For example, an int type is not a char type. 
 */

/** for-each loop */
/* normal for-loops uses conditions to know how many times to iterate
 * 
 * What if you needed to iterate through each object in a set? 
 *
 * For example, each Character in a Character array?
 *
 * Character[] charArray = {'c', 'a', 'g'};
 * for(Character c: charArray){
 *      System.out.println(c); 
 *      // iterates through each char in the char array
 * }
 *
 * Can be done with other iterable sets, like ArrayLists.

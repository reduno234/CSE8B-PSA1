 // Although you will not be graded on style this week, you should follow
 // these basic style guidelines nonetheless.   You will be graded on this
 // in weeks to come, so start to practice now.

 // Use proper indenting: Indent each block of code (e.g., method body,
 //   loop body.  Line up the lines in the block so that they are all
 //   indented to the same degree.  See examples of this in the book
 //   and in the code below.
 // Use descriptive variable names: The names of your variables should
 //   describe the data they hold.  Almost always, your variable names
 //   should be words (or abbreviations), not single letters.
 // Write short methods: Break your methods up into submethods if they
 //   are getting too complicated or long.  Generally your methods
 //   shouldn't get too much longer than about 20 lines of code (give or take)
 // Write short lines: Each line of code should be no longer than 80
 //   characters, so it can fit in a reasonable size window.  There's a
 //   column number in both vim and emacs.
 //
 // We'll start with these, as these are the most important.  We may add
 // to this list later in the term, but if you do all of the above you're
 // in good shape.

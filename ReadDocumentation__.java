/**
 * Tester assignment
 *
 * Overview: 
 * In this assignment, you will be reading documentation in method and class
 * headers in order to write tester methods that will gauge the correctness 
 * of the methods.
 *
 * Rules: 
 * You must base the testing on the documentation without
 * reading the code. The code has been obfuscated to make
 * the process a little harder, but for your own learning,
 * use only the documentation. We can't stop you, but we are
 * trying to prepare you for programming beyond 8B. 
 *
 * By no means is this file even remotely to be used for style
 * guidelines at all. This file is an example of bad style.
 * 
 * Some methods will give you the result in a print statement while other
 * methods will give you the result in a return type. Pay attention to 
 * the parameters and the return type. (Refer to terms.java)
 *
 * TODO Write your testers in the separate Testers.java. 
 *
 * No need to work on style for this specific file at all.
 * Best viewed in VIM. 
 *
 * Intended time for this part: 30 minutes
 *

     *
     * {1, 2} + {2, 0} 
     * will return {3, 2}

     * Input: two Integer arrays f and s (first and second)
     * Output: an Integer[] that is the sum of the two inputs.

    /* TODO
     * Assume the lowest allowable input for min is 65 and the 
     * highest allowable max is 115. min must always <= max. 
     *
     * This method will return a String[]. Each String inside will
     * contain (Index + (Index % 3)) characters concatonated with 
     * each other. 
     *
     * You may assume that there are no Strings started at index 0 and 
     * ending at but including index 64. The assignment may start at index
     * 65. 
     *
     * For example: Index 5 will be 
     * (5 + (5 % 3)) == (5 + 2) == 7
     * so the String could be "########". 
     * (The character is not necessarily #, as explained by the following.)
     *
     * But this example will never happen because the lowest allowable 
     * input is 65. 
     *
     * The calculated index of the string, which is an int-type, will
     * be used to find the corresponding character (char-type) using
     * ASCII values. For example, according to http://www.asciitable.com/,
     * the decimal 65 is the capital letter A. 
     *
     * Input: int min, int max
     * Output: String[] containing Strings of variable length whose chars 
     * are determined by the index.
